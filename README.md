_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Blossom Bank also known as BB PLC is a multinational financial services group, that offers retail and investment banking, pension management, asset management and payments services, headquartered in London, UK. 

Customers are vulnerable to transaction fraud everyday. On this basis, the bank is in a dire need for a fraud detection  model to help predict transaction crime. A constant reoccurrence of fraudulent incident will diminish the bank customer’s trust and affect the productivity of the bank. Hence, detecting and preventing fraud is important to the Bank.


 I took the following steps in this project
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

I performed exploratory data analysis using python to:
a) Visualize relationships between the label and some key features
b) Explore correlations
c) Conduct univariate and multivariate analysis.


I also performed feature engineering by:
a) Encoding categorical variables
b) Created new features from existing features where necessary, depending on 
insights from Exploratory Data Analysis

I modelled the selection, training, and validation of data, trained and tested at least 2 supervised learning model which includes: 
Decision Tree and Linear Regression model
